# Buoys

A site I made for a customer wanting to keep track of the buoys in the current lakes. Was really interesting working with the weather API, google maps API and adding a login system to keep track of users favorite buoys. Adding the stream from the buoys was also challenging but once added was completely rewarding. You can view the site  [here](https://nicklaranjeiro.github.io/buoys)
